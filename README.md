## Pathfinding Visualiser

- Dijkstra's algorithm is a popular algorithm used to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. The visualization allows you to see how the algorithm explores the graph and determines the shortest path.

- Along with Dijikstra's Algorithm this visualiser provides you how other Algorithms like A* - Star , DFS and BFS searching;

- you can play around with this website link :
